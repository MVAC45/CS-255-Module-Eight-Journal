Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

This project involved designing a system for the client DriverPass. They wanted a comprehensive system to help students prepare for their driving test by providing online practice tests and on the road training. The system needed to support functionalities like user accounts, test reservation for in person driving lessons, and tracking of training progress.

What did you do particularly well?

I felt that I was able to create UML diagrams well. They were clear in explaining the goal of said objective like the activity diagram I made.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would look at my UML Class diagram, I feel that I can go further in depth with it. Mainly providing better names for the classes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpret the user's needs by reviewing the interview transcripts and understanding DriverPass’s requirements for the system. Their key needs were user authentication, the ability to book and manage driving lessons, access to online practice tests, and secure management of user data. When considering the user’s needs, it’s important because it ensures that the final product is functional, efficient, and user-friendly. By focusing on users’ needs, I created a more effective and reliable system that meets the client’s objectives and supports their business goals.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I would begin by understanding the clients’ requirements through interviews and reviewing documentation. From there I can create a detailed design plan, where I can define both functional and nonfunctional requirements. Use case diagrams and UML diagrams, such as activity, sequence, and class diagrams to help visualize the system's structure and behavior. In the future I plan to use the agile methodology for flexibility and continuous improvement.
